This directory contains design files for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on which the components are soldered. 
The Tinymesh module is surface-mount soldered, while the other components are tradiitonal through-hole. 

The board design has no fixed copper wiring between the components, so that it is possible to use for experimentation and test different designs
without printing new PCBs.

The files are created using [Eagle] (https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download)
