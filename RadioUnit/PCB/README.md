This directory contains design files for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on which the components are soldered. 
The Tinymesh module is surface-mount soldered, while the other components are traditional through-hole. 

The board design has no fixed copper wiring between the components. This makes it possible to use for experimentation and test different designs without printing new PCBs.

The files are created using [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download).
I ordered the boards from [Eurocircuits](https://www.eurocircuits.com/blog/NAKED-proto/). It cost 48,5 EUR incl VAT and shipping for 5 boards. See order details in the file [E855315.pdf](./E855315.pdf).
