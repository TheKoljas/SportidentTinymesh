This directory contains design files for the Printed Circuit Board (PCB) on which the components are soldered. 
The Tinymesh module is surface-mount soldered, while the other components are traditional through-hole. 

The board design has no fixed copper wiring between the components. This makes it possible to use for experimentation and test different designs without printing new PCBs.

The files are created using [Eagle](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/free-download).
I ordered the boards from [Eurocircuits](https://www.eurocircuits.com/blog/NAKED-proto/). 
5 boards cost 48,5 EUR incl VAT and shipping. See order details in the file [E855315.pdf](./E855315.pdf). If you refer to that, or maybe "PCB B0826634", and they have saved my specification and design, you may be able to order new copies the exact same PCB that I got. I can confirm it is suitable for the components I used including the Tinymesh module. 

Here is a good video tutorial (from the great Collin's Lab) on hand solering a surface mount component with QFN package like the Tinymesh module:
